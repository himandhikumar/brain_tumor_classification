## üîß Activities Performed

### üß™ Data Preparation
- Preprocessed MRI images: Resized, normalized, and converted to tensors.
- Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### üß† Model Building
- Implemented and trained various models:
  - Baseline Linear and Non-linear Neural Nets
  - Basic CNN
  - Pretrained ResNet18 and ResNet50
  - EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3

### üìâ Training & Evaluation
- Fine-tuned pretrained models using Transfer Learning.
- Tracked performance metrics: Loss, Accuracy.
- Selected best-performing model (EfficientNetB0).

### üåê Web App Deployment
- Built a user-friendly Streamlit app:
  - Upload MRI image
  - Get tumor prediction + confidence score
  - See progress visually
- Deployed app on Streamlit Cloud.
